## Recommendations

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? 

If I were to give Microsoft some advice, I'd tell them to implement support for older updates of their OS, or just stop forcing updates that don't prioritize the customer. Instead of finding ways to place ads on their OS, they should focus on security and ease of use.

### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

This would make Microsoft more trustworthy. People will see that Microsoft prioritizes customer satisfaction over material gain. People will talk about Microsoft and how good their OS is, making more people to want to use Microsoft's OS. The more people using use Microsoft's OS the more awareness the rest of their products will gain.

### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

This advice could utilize customer support or even AI to gather data based on how people feel about each major update. Using the data gathered, they can make a decision on whether that major update is worth pushing for.

### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

AI is appropriate for this solution simply because of the sheer number of people who currently utilize Microsoft's OS in their daily lives. There would be too much data for a group of people to look through in a timely manner.
